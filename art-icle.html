				<p id="what">What makes Filipino Islamic art so interesting?<br><br>Arriving to the Philippines in the 13th century, Islam has developed its own style of art. Islamic art perfectly shows respect and beauty towards its teachings. Since there must be an absence of human form in its art, the use of geometric shapes and patterns are emphasized.
				Islamic culture mixed with ethnic culture in the Philippines, producing Filipino Muslim art which both reflects the Islamic identity and ethnic background of people.
				Even with the arrival of the Spaniards to colonize the Philippines, Filipino-Muslim art continued to flourish.
				One popular kind of Filipino-Muslim is <i>okkir</i>. <i>Okkir</i> is a traditional art form believed to be influence by the Hindus and Chinese. It uses wavelike and intricate details to insinuate the form of a serpent or dragon which is a popular motif.

				<p id="patterns">African patterns on clothes can be a symbol of status, hierarchy and allegiance to tribal roots. The colors in the cloth also hold meaning. White signifies purity. Gold represents wealth and green represents prosperity. Red shows blood and trouble while blue shows love and peace.</p>
