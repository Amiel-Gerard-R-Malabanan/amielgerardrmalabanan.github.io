				<p id="patterns">Africa has a variety of creative patterns. Their colors on clothes can be a symbol of status, hierarchy and allegiance to tribal roots. The colors in the cloth also hold meaning.
				White signifies purity. Gold represents wealth and green represents prosperity. Red shows blood and trouble while blue shows love and peace. Most of these patterns come from the surroundings of the people who created them. They can be seen in almost all works of art from walls, doors, tiles, ceramics, baskets, furnitures, pottery, jewelry, artifacts, woven textiles, clothing and so much more.
